                    <h1>Downfall of humanity</h1>
                    <p>
                        After industrial spaceflight was available and humanity has expanded amongst
                        the solar system. Tensions grew on earth. A majority of the population
                        decided to reject religion and cultures to further progress humanity. As
                        this majority saw the principles of religion and culture as a burden. In
                        their vision this would halt progression in development of genetic
                        engineering, praying and upholding ancient traditions caused people to lose
                        track of inventions and created different perspectives. Barriers with
                        different languages caused too many mistakes in the past. War and politics
                        were driven by biased opinions of inherited cultures. This majority became
                        the movement known as the Ultra-atheists. They quickly rose to power as they
                        had no limit written by a bible or a standard of life to hold on to. They
                        used what they had and morality of what was right and wrong in scriptures of
                        old were discarded. New rules of living were created. LGBT movements and
                        other human intrinsic values were once again looked upon as an illness. For
                        these ultra-atheists the rules of living were:
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Work and private lives shall not be interfered with biased opinions of
                        heritage.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Cultures and religion of old are suppressions of creativity and inventions.
                        Judgements shall be based upon facts and not to be clouded with old human
                        principles.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Human morality is based upon progression, if one halts it, it is deemed
                        obsolete.
                    </p>
                    <h1>The schism</h1>
                    <p>
                        Many countries were split between these ideals, thus the great schism
                        appeared. Followers of old human values were maddened by these oppressive
                        ideals of the ultra-atheists. They wanted to hold on to the heritage they
                        got from their ancestral lines. For that would make them human. After some
                        policies were declared that no more churches or religions could be built and
                        the remaining establishments of religion should follow a strict conduct of
                        supervision, the bombings began. Institutes of ultra-atheists amongst
                        thousands of bystanders were targeted. After the bombings the schism was
                        completed. The ultra-atheists have made up their mind and convinced the
                        remaining neutral parties to step aside. A genocide ensued targeting all
                        beliefs, religions and old human principles.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Millions upon millions of people died, both sides had severe losses.
                        Governments had fallen, but for the ultra-atheists a type of geniocracy was
                        established. This strengthened their power and disabled the time spent in
                        bureaucracy. Neutral parties were quickly absorbed in both sides. A meeting
                        was made between both parties in an attempt to further stop the genocide,
                        however the ultra-atheists used this opportunity to take out all remaining
                        leaders of the old world. In the chaos that followed, the last pilgrimage of
                        humanity was initiated.
                    </p>
                    <h1>The last pilgrimage</h1>
                    <p>
                        After the downfall of old human values and the rise of the geniocracy of the
                        ultra-atheists, spacecraft were developed and existing ones retrofitted to
                        accommodate masses amounts of people and storage of relics of old. The
                        ultra-atheists saw this migration but were not ordered to take down the
                        spacecraft upon departure. As somewhere deep down, even the ultra-atheist
                        understood that migration is a part of what humanity stands for.

                        depend on Industrial Commonwealth of Planets, but they are the major
